Every time, pull the new one from website first.  
Just edit your own file in your own dir.  
every one can use other one file, but don't edit it.  
if we do something new, create a new text file in "NEW" file with name data and time. 
for example: the name of the text file will like"3/30 12:26 Runnan"£¬
and write down what you do in the this text file. 
don't forget to "commit-push" when you do something.
I will combine the things when we post HW.
